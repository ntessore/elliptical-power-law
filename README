ELLIPTICAL POWER LAW PROFILE LENS
SAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION

This is a sample implementation to compute the angular dependency of the
deflection of the elliptical power law profile lens (Tessore & Metcalf 2015).

In order to compute the deflection from the contained `epl_omega` function,
you must multiply it by the radial dependency:

    alpha = (2 b)/(1 + q) (b/R)^(t - 1) omega(phi)

You are free to use this code in any way you like, but if you do, please cite
Tessore & Metcalf (2015) in your resulting publications.
